# Random Drops in Unity

This example project has a chest which will randomly pick an item when you open it. It uses the reusable [WeightedRandomList.cs](https://github.com/vectorbread/random-drops/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeightedRandomList.cs) script which lets you assign different weights to each item in the list so some are more often chosen than others. Bring [WeightedRandomList.cs](https://github.com/vectorbread/random-drops/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeightedRandomList.cs) into your Game Dev projects whenever you need it.

The 3D Models come from the amazing [KayKit: Dungeon Pack 1.0](https://opengameart.org/content/kaykit-dungeon-pack-10)
